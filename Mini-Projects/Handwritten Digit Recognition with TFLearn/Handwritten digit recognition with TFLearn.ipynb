    "Flattening the data throws away information about the 2D structure of the image, but it simplifies our data so that all of the training data can be contained in one array whose shape is [55000, 784]; the first dimension is the number of training images and the second dimension is the number of pixels in each image. This is the kind of data that is easy to analyze using a simple neural network."

    "2. Hidden layers, which recognize patterns in data and connect the input to the output layer, and\n",
    "3. The output layer, which defines how the network learns and outputs a label for a given image.\n",

    "net = tflearn.input_data([None, 100])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding layers\n",
    "\n",
    "To add new hidden layers, you use \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "net = tflearn.fully_connected(net, n_units, activation='ReLU')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This adds a fully connected layer where every unit (or node) in the previous layer is connected to every unit in this layer. The first argument `net` is the network you created in the `tflearn.input_data` call, it designates the input to the hidden layer. You can set the number of units in the layer with `n_units`, and set the activation function with the `activation` keyword. You can keep adding layers to your network by repeated calling `tflearn.fully_connected(net, n_units)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to set how you train the network, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "net = tflearn.regression(net, optimizer='sgd', learning_rate=0.1, loss='categorical_crossentropy')\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "* `optimizer` sets the training method, here stochastic gradient descent\n",
    "* `learning_rate` is the learning rate\n",
    "* `loss` determines how the network error is calculated. In this example, with categorical cross-entropy.\n",
